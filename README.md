SUMMARY
This is a simple website where users can sign up for an account and login
and logout of their account and play Jotto once they have an account.
Jotto is a word game that Susan introduced in class so I don’t think I
need to explain it, but there are fairly detailed instructions for how to
play on the gameplay page if a refresher is required.

FEATURES
- signup for an account
- - basic error checking on user input from signup form
- account login
- - basic error checking on user input from login form
- account logout
- “restricted access” view (routes to index page with message to login)
- 3-pane view that displays current user games as well as a list of all users
- ability to view user profiles (containing very basic gameplay statistics)
- ability to start new games
- ability to leave a game at any point and resume it later from that point
- GAMEPLAY FEATURES:
- - view list of previous guesses and computer responses
- - alphabet with color-changing letters to help user mark when they have
	determined a letter to be in or out of the secret word
- - reset alphabet to default colors if user made an error
- - error checking on user guess input

JAVASCRIPT
All gameplay is handled via Javascript and AJAX calls. The entire game
play area is just a single page that’s being manipulated with jQuery.
There isn’t much integration between the Javascript and the PHP, I suppose,
but I felt this was cleaner and made more sense anyway.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
Some aspects of the game are difficult to explain without a wall of text,
and I apologize for that; hopefully the layout is intuitive enough.

Originally, I had planned to make it a more social website where users
could initiate games with other users, but that turned out to be more
difficult than I could handle in the time I had (which was much shorter
than it could have been, and I’m really sorry this is so late).
